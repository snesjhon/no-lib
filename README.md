# No Lib
My personal attempt to create different react packages... without the actual packages. 

### React Router
Inspiration : https://reacttraining.com/react-router/


### Redux
Inspiration: https://redux.js.org/


## Motivation
Although it's great to know exactly what kind of packages you should use, it's also good to know how the packages are actually built. 

Obviously, you can go and look at the source, but this is more about accomplishing the task in as little code as possible.
